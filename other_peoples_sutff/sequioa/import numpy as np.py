threshold_bouts function:
Added comments to describe the purpose and behavior of the function.
Changed variable names to be more descriptive (iti_mask, bout_mask, delete_indices).
Used numpy's np.where function to find indices where conditions are met, improving readability.
Utilized numpy's np.diff function to calculate differences between consecutive elements efficiently.
Removed unnecessary variable no_bouts as it was not being used.
Reshaped the array using reshape instead of np.reshape for consistency.
get_behavior_bouts function:
Added comments to describe the purpose and behavior of the function.
Changed variable names to be more descriptive (start_stop_arrays, subject_df, behavior_df).
Removed unnecessary intermediate variables and calculations for efficiency.
Utilized list comprehension and np.concatenate directly to simplify code.
Removed redundant multiplication by 1000 as it's done after the array is returned.
save_behavior_bouts function:
Added comments to describe the purpose and behavior of the function.
Changed variable names to be more descriptive (subject_str, behavior_str).
Used map function to convert subject list to string for filename generation.
Combined multiple if conditions to format filename, making it more concise.
Removed unnecessary type checks as they were not required for the function's behavior.
Improved spacing and formatting for better readability.
These changes collectively improve the readability, efficiency, and clarity of the code while maintaining its functionality.
